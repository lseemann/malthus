Malthus is a simple, unscientific model of population growth over a single year. For these purposes, it is a population of rats.

Four variables can be controlled:
* Weeks until fertility
* Weeks between litters
* Size of litters
* Weeks until death

Two tables are generated: A week-by-week table of total rats, sorted by generation, and a week-by-week table to new rats, sorted by generation.

##Caveats##
* The real world is much more complex. It's unlikely that any biologist would approve of this model.
* Each rat exists at a lightweight Javascript object. After 5 million rats or so, this has the potential to crash browsers.
